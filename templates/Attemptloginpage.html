            For this project you are required to build a text-based chat application, meaning the user of the application enters text or similar prompts, and recieves responses, but you may interpret the concept with a good deal of flexibility:
            The application could be a traditional Chat service, perhaps linking people looking for Web Design help, and experts offering help;
            The application could use a chatbot mechanism similar to Eliza;
            The application could make use of a 3rd party service like GPT orWolfram Alpha;
            The application could use chat in a larger context, like a service for online role playing games or in Twenty Questions type games;
            You could use chat as a game mechanism like the Monkey Island games.
